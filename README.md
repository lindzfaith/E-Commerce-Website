This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Credit

The original design comes from an online Javascript course I participated in. This course (and the original project) was created by adrianhajdin and can be found here: https://github.com/adrianhajdin/ecommerce_sanity_stripe. However, I made a multitude of CSS changes and am currently working on creating new pages and making changes to personalize the website further to my preferences. I did not clone his repository. Outside of the original stylesheet (that I have altered and added to), I typed every line of code in the components, context, and pages. 

I am actively expanding my Javascript capabilities to implement new features to this design. I am currently working on adding a sale price system and a separate products page in between my busy schedule as a Computer Science student.
